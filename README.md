# About

I shared a data set in a text chat and ended up roping myself into writing something on using soils in STZ development; turns out @person isn't how you do private message in teams chats. FML. 
I accept 60% of responsibility for this and blame a BLM employee for the other 40% ;-). 

Here I work on creating some pretty boilerplate backgrounds which I anticipate can be spun out by other authors to suit particular needs.
