This should have two main sections: 
  1) How geomorphology and soil relations mediate microclimate, and how classifying STZs by climate alone may miss these relationships
    a) phenotypes captured in common gardens may have earlier phenology to sync with timing of soil moisture (sandy soils), less growth due to size 
    b) local adaption may be to soil environments, e.g. nutrient levels, soil texture, 
  2) How geomorphology can be incorporated into seed lot selection retroactively
    a) I.e. moving populations from sandy sites to sandy sites 
    b) Using Ecological Site Descriptions, and Ecological Site Groups to select for plants from similar sites 
      1) ESD's very fine not mapped to raster surfaces, but can capture large areas (valleys) decently 
      2) ESG's sync up with most post-fire restoration activities. 
    c) When available using plot based data, e.g. AIM to determine vegetation similarity between collection site and target site. 
      1) Sorenson-Dice, Jaccard index for species richness macroplots 
      2) NMDS, other metrics which capture major vegetation components which are caught by standardized monitoring. 



The effects of climate on plants can be mediated by both landforms and soils across a range of scales (Moesland et al 2013). 
Climate may be mediated by altering the micro climate through phenomena such as cold pools and micro-rain shadows (Pastore et al. 2022, Minder et al. 2008).  

Further slope and aspect control the amount of incipient solar radiation altering both soil temperatures and soil moisture  (Dearborn and Danby 2017, ). 

The availability of soil moisture is influenced by the amount of coarse fragments in soil (cite), and it's textural (cite), and chemical properties (e.g. soil organic carbon, carbonates) (Duniway et al. 2010, CITE), and the interactions of these variables with up slope drainage generated by landforms (McAuliffe 1994, Wondzell et al. 1996). 
Collectively, these factors can lead to an apparent decoupling between climate variables generated by spatial modelling and interpolation approaches, and the responses of plant populations. 

Fortunately, in response to these well known phenomena a variety of approaches for 'downscaling' gridded climate data from moderate resolutions (e.g. ~800m, ~1km) to fine resolutions have been developed (e.g. climateNA).  
However, while these tools are more effective for modelling the variability in localized climate, they do not address the effects of geomorphology on precipitation.
